# Lox Interpreter in Rust

## About the Project
This repository, `lox_interpreter`, showcases my journey in implementing an interpreter for the Lox programming language, done in Rust. As a novice Rust programmer, this project serves as both a learning experience and a demonstration of Rust's capabilities. The goal is to create a functional and efficient interpreter for Lox, a language known for its simplicity.
I'm doing that with the help of the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- To run this project, Rust must be installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tareq-Assiri/lox_interpreter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd lox_interpreter
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage
To run a Lox program, execute the following command:
```bash
cargo run [path_to_your_lox_program.lox]
```
Replace `[path_to_your_lox_program.lox]` with the path to your Lox file.

## Features
- **An Awesome Interpreter:** Experience the power and simplicity of Lox through this well-crafted interpreter.
- **Pretty Good Executable:** Built to run efficiently, offering a reliable and user-friendly interface.
- **Made in Rust:** Leverage the robustness and safety features of Rust in this interpreter - because everything's better with Rust!
